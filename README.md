## Style bot for DLS
This telegram bot uses StyleGAN to transfer styles from paintings to photos (available styles are Monet and Vangogh). 
It is built using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
and [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) libraries.
Original realization of CycleGAN architecture
and the relevant paper can be found [here](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/). I wrote my own realization and used datasets from the original paper to train it. The training notebooks and
generated sample images can be found in a
[separate repository](https://example.com).
